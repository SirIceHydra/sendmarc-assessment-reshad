# Dangling DNS: Understanding the hidden threat to your domain security

Dangling DNS records are often overlooked vulnerabilities that can put your organization’s reputation and security at serious risk. Although it’s easy to miss, the consequences can be severe, ranging from phishing attacks to brand impersonation and data exposure.

But what does dangling DNS mean, and why should every business, especially those managing multiple domains or using third-party services, care about it? This article explores the meaning, risks, real-world examples, and solutions for DNS dangling, with information on how Sendmarc’s platform can help protect your brand.

## What is dangling DNS?

Dangling DNS refers to when a DNS record points to a domain, subdomain, or resource that no longer exists or isn’t under a company’s control anymore. In simple terms, it’s like leaving a signpost to a building that’s been knocked down or taken over by someone else.

Dangling DNS is commonly caused by:
* Deactivating servers without updating DNS records
* Letting domains or subdomains expire or lapse
* Poor DNS hygiene and record management

In fast-moving environments, DNS updates can fall through the cracks. Without consistent oversight, even well-equipped teams can overlook critical changes, leaving the door open for cybercriminals.

## Why do dangling DNS records matter?

Dangling DNS records are a real and growing cyber risk. Cybercriminals can exploit them to hijack subdomains, impersonate brands, or launch phishing attacks that appear legitimate to unsuspecting users.

Key DNS dangling risks include:

* **Email spoofing and abuse:** Compromised subdomains could potentially bypass your organization’s protections, enabling attackers to send fraudulent emails that appear legitimate.
* **Data breaches:** Users who trust your business’s subdomain might interact with malicious emails, potentially exposing sensitive internal or customer data.
* **Reputational damage:** If your brand is used in phishing campaigns or spoofing scams, trust can quickly vanish among customers, partners, and the public, leading to long-term reputational damage.

A study conducted between 2020 and 2023 identified 20,904 subdomain hijacks globally that contained malicious content. This shows how necessary it is for companies to adopt preventive measures before vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited.

## How do dangling DNS records happen?

Dangling DNS vulnerabilities typically originate from mismanagement or oversight. Below are common causes.

| Cause | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Third-party service changes** | Changes or discontinuation of external services happen without DNS record cleanup. |
| **Domain expiry** | Subdomains or domains expire, but the linked DNS records stay active. |
| **Poor DNS hygiene** | Organizations fail to conduct regular audits or updates to DNS configurations. |
| **Typos** | Mistyped domain names in DNS records can lead to invalid or unintended destinations. |

Many businesses struggle with limited visibility into DNS configurations across teams. As a result, outdated records can go undetected for months – or even years – until they’re either discovered by the company or exploited by attackers.

## Real-world examples of dangling DNS

In 2023, researchers showed how even major international organizations are vulnerable to dangling DNS. These included government bodies, top universities (like UCLA and Stanford), global media outlets (such as CNN), and financial institutions.

When attackers exploit these vulnerabilities, they can expose users to a range of serious threats, including:

* **Malware distribution:** Hijacked subdomains can be used to distribute malicious software, potentially compromising recipient systems and networks.
* **Misinformation spread:** Threat actors can exploit the credibility of reputable institutions to spread false or misleading information.
* **Phishing attacks:** Attackers can create convincing phishing emails from the trusted subdomain to trick users into revealing credentials or sensitive data.

## How to detect and prevent dangling DNS

Proactive management and continuous monitoring are key to reducing the risk of a dangling DNS record.

Follow these best practices to secure your business’s DNS:

* **Conduct regular DNS audits:** Routinely review all DNS records, especially after deactivating services or updating third-party tools.
* **Use automated monitoring features:** Use tools that scan and alert your company to DNS record changes. Automated monitoring helps identify issues before attackers do.
* **Promote education and enforce policies:** Train internal teams on the risks tied to DNS hygiene and implement formal DNS management policies. These policies should clarify roles and ensure accountability.
