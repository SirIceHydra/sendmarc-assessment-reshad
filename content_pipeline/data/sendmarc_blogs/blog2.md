# Why anti-spam alone won’t protect you: The case for DMARC

By the end of 2025, cybercrime is expected to cost the global economy $1.2 trillion annually, making it one of the highest risks organizations face today.

Most businesses already rely on some form of anti-spam. The service plays a vital role in filtering out spam before it reaches recipients’ inboxes.

But here’s the reality: Anti-spam alone isn’t enough. If your email security strategy stops at spam filtering, your company – and everyone it communicates with – is still exposed to domain impersonation and phishing attacks.

Let’s look at why.

## What anti-spam tools do well

Anti-spam software forms a necessary first layer of defense. It scans and filters incoming emails, helping prevent spam from reaching users. This protects employees, reduces distractions, and improves productivity.

Every organization should have anti-spam software in place. Without it, inboxes can quickly become cluttered with unsolicited and harmful emails. This can result in missed legitimate communications, wasted time, and increased cyber risk.

But as important as these tools are, they only address inbound email threats. That is just one side of the equation.

## Anti-spam doesn’t protect against the real threat

While anti-spam solutions work to keep threats out, they don’t protect your domain from being impersonated by cybercriminals. Attackers can spoof your domain to send fraudulent messages to your customers, suppliers, and the rest of the world – emails that appear legitimate at first glance.

This tactic is called domain impersonation. It is a common and highly effective form of phishing. These fake emails often use your business’s branding to appear trustworthy, tricking recipients into transferring money, sharing sensitive data, or clicking on malicious links.

Because these messages are sent from outside your email environment, your anti-spam software won’t detect or stop them.

That is where Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) comes in.

## DMARC: The missing layer in your anti-spam strategy

DMARC is a powerful email authentication protocol that prevents cybercriminals from misusing your domain. While anti-spam software focuses on filtering incoming cyberthreats, DMARC secures your outbound email traffic, ensuring only authorized sources can send messages from your domain.

With DMARC in place, every email that claims to come from your domain is checked for authenticity. If the message fails the check, it can be rejected or quarantined. Whether it’s a customer receiving a fake invoice or a supplier targeted with fraudulent payment details, DMARC helps stop the email before it reaches the recipient.

DMARC works alongside Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) to authenticate your email. It also provides actionable reports and insights into how your domain is being used.

## Anti-spam vs. DMARC: Why you need both

You don’t need to choose between anti-spam software and DMARC protection – they solve different problems and work best when used together.

| Feature | Anti-spam | DMARC |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Focus | Inbound email | Outbound email |
| Protects employees | Yes | Yes |
| Safeguards customers and suppliers | No | Yes |
| Prevents spam | Yes | No |
| Reduces domain impersonation | No | Yes |
| Provides email visibility | Limited | Extensive reporting |

When combined, anti-spam and DMARC create a layered email security strategy that protects both internal users and external contacts. This approach is considered a best practice in modern cybersecurity frameworks.

## Layering anti-spam and DMARC

Cybercriminals are constantly adapting. They use lookalike domains and advanced phishing tactics to bypass traditional defenses and exploit users. Earlier this year, it was found that the weekly volume of phishing emails increased by 180% since 2023, proving the need for preventative solutions.

Companies must protect both directions of email traffic:

* **Inbound:** Anti-spam filters block junk, malware, and known phishing attempts from reaching employees’ inboxes.
* **Outbound:** DMARC prevents attackers from spoofing your domain to target external recipients.

By securing both inbound and outbound email flows, your organization protects its brand, secures communications, and builds trust with stakeholders.

## DMARC that works with your anti-spam setup

At Sendmarc, we help businesses of all sizes implement DMARC in a way that complements their existing cybersecurity infrastructure.
